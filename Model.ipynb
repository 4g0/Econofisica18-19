    "### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "The purpose of this model is to study, through agent-based simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    " - the evolution of prices depending on the interest rate;\n",
    "\n",
    " - the reciprocal influence among agents through the methodology of networks aimed at behavior in the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HOW TO SET\n",
    "It is possible to choose the schedules of the interest rate and of the actions executed by agents. For the interest rate schedule, you can set the interest rate (Low, Medium, High) and how many cycles it should remain (i.e. 50 cycles). For the actions schedule, you can set the actions that will execute the agents and their order of execution, specifying the type of agent and the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to decide:\n",
    "- the number of households\n",
    "- the percentage of households that will act like numbs (randomly choosing the action to do, just depending on the current interest rate) in the stock market\n",
    "- the number of firms, that will also be the number of titles in the stock market\n",
    "- the number of cycles to run\n",
    "- the seed for the random function\n",
    "- the \"verbose\", that permits to have a comment and the results of every action done by the agents\n",
    "- if the network for reciprocal influences should be enabled (and, in case, the probability of a connection between agents)\n",
    "- if the unemployment should be implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of these parameters is chosen, it is possible to use the default ones, see GlobalVariables.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SCHEDULES\n",
    "We propose different schedules for the action performed in the cycle and different schedules for the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schedules containing the actions performed are composed of a list in which the elements are the type of the agent performing the action and the action itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate scheduling is composed of a number indicating the tick up to which the interest rate is kept at a value and the value of the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the pdf for more informations.\n",
